using oneapi-cli
oneAPI Libraries/oneMKL/Block Cholesky Decomposition -> oneapi-tuts\block_cholesky_decomposition

As noted in (README.md)[block_cholesky_decomposition/README.md] linking process takes very long time and process is thus unusable for development.
Resulting exe is 143 MB
Process uses icx-cl from oneAPI and contains sycl code
```
